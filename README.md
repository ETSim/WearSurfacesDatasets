# Friction Surfaces Dataset

A collection of friction surface images with tools for data processing and analysis.

## What's in this dataset?

- Surface images for different materials (Cartboard, MDF, PLA)
- Images show how surfaces change with wear under different weights
- Various image types (height maps, normal maps, etc.)

## Directory Structure
